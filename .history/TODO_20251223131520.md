# Admin Panel Enhancement - Home and ILC Page Full Editability

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Added Title Editor for Home and ILC Pages
- Added a title input field in the AdminPanel UI that appears only for 'home' and 'ilc' pages
- The title editor is styled with a gradient background and proper form controls

### 2. Updated Save Function
- Modified the `savePage` function to include the title in the update data for home and ilc pages
- The function now conditionally adds the title field when saving these specific pages

### 3. UI Integration
- The title editor is positioned prominently in the page editor interface
- Maintains consistent styling with the rest of the admin panel

## Technical Details

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/AdminPanel.jsx`

**Key Changes:**
- Added conditional title input field for home/ilc pages
- Updated savePage function to include title in API calls
- Maintained backward compatibility for other pages

**Features Added:**
- Dynamic title editing for home and ilc pages
- Real-time title updates in the admin interface
- Proper error handling and loading states

## Testing Notes

The changes allow administrators to:
1. Edit the page title for home and ilc pages directly in the admin panel
2. Save both title and section changes simultaneously
3. See immediate feedback in the UI when editing titles

All other pages remain unchanged and continue to use their hardcoded titles as before.
